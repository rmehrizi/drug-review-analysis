# drug-review-analysis
In this notebook, I used Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to predict a drug rating score based on patient reviews. Learning from the experience of real people who have taken drug treatments can help other patients to find the most effective drug. The dataset is from Kaggle's website (https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/kuc-hackathon-winter-2018). The main goal of this notebook is using various NLP techniques to convert reviews into numerical values and then evaluate their performance in terms of text classification accuracy.)
